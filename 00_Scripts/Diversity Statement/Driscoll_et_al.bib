To better understand how the brain transitions from healthy to seizing on a local scale, we induced focal epileptiform activity in the visual cortex of five anesthetized cats with local application of the GABAA blocker picrotoxin while simultaneously recording local field potentials on a high-resolution electrocorticography array and laminar depth probes. Epileptiform activity appeared in the form of isolated events, revealing a consistent temporal pattern of ictogenesis across animals with interictal events consistently preceding the appearance of seizures. Based on the number of spikes per event, there was a natural separation between seizures and shorter interictal events. Two distinct spatial regions were seen: an epileptic focus that grew in size as activity progressed,...},

abstract = {SUMMARY Objective: Evaluate the seizure-reduction response and safety of mesial temporal lobe (MTL) brain-responsive stimulation in adults with medically intractable partial-onset seizures of mesial temporal lobe origin. Methods: Subjects with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) were identified from prospective clinical trials of a brain-responsive neurostimulator (RNS System, Neuro-Pace). The seizure reduction over years 2–6 postimplantation was calculated by assess-ing the seizure frequency compared to a preimplantation baseline. Safety was assessed based on reported adverse events. Results: There were 111 subjects with MTLE; 72{\%} of subjects had bilateral MTL onsets and 28{\%} had unilateral onsets. Subjects had one to four leads placed; only two leads could be connected to the device. Seventy-six subjects had depth leads only, 29 had both depth and strip leads, and 6 had only strip leads. The mean follow-up was 6.1 AE (standard deviation) 2.2 years. The median percent seizure reduction was 70{\%} (last observation carried forward). Twenty-nine percent of subjects experienced at least one seizure-free period of 6 months or longer, and 15{\%} experienced at least one sei-zure-free period of 1 year or longer. There was no difference in seizure reduction in subjects with and without mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), bilateral MTL onsets, prior resection, prior intracranial monitoring, and prior vagus nerve stimulation. In addi-tion, seizure reduction was not dependent on the location of depth leads relative to the hippocampus. The most frequent serious device-related adverse event was soft tis-sue implant-site infection (overall rate, including events categorized as device-related, uncertain, or not device-related: 0.03 per implant year, which is not greater than with other neurostimulation devices). Significance: Brain-responsive stimulation represents a safe and effective treatment option for patients with medically intractable epilepsy, including patients with unilat-eral or bilateral MTLE who are not candidates for temporal lobectomy or who have failed a prior MTL resection.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop a platform in which the cellular and molecular underpinnings of chronic focal neocortical lesional epilepsy can be explored and use it to characterize seizure-like events (SLEs) in an ex vivo model of infiltrating high-grade glioma. Microelectrode arrays were used to study electrophysiologic changes in ex vivo acute brain slices from a PTEN/p53 deleted, PDGF-B driven mouse model of high-grade glioma. Electrode locations were co-registered to the underlying histology to ascertain the influence of the varying histologic landscape on the observed electrophysiologic changes. Peritumoral, infiltrated, and tumor sites were sampled in tumor-bearing slices. Following the addition of zero Mg2+ solution, all three histologic regions in tumor-bearing slices showed significantly greater increases in firing rates when compared to the control sites. Tumor-bearing slices demonstrated increased proclivity for SLEs, with 40 events in tumor-bearing slices and 5 events in control slices (p-value = .0105). Observed SLEs were characterized by either low voltage fast (LVF) onset patterns or short bursts of repetitive widespread, high amplitude low frequency discharges. Seizure foci comprised areas from all three histologic regions. The onset electrode was found to be at the infiltrated margin in 50{\%} of cases and in the peritumoral region in 36.9{\%} of cases. These findings reveal a landscape of histopathologic and electrophysiologic alterations associated with ictogenesis and spread of tumor-associated seizures.},

Comprehension of the complex mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and seizure generation in temporal lobe epilepsy and other forms of epilepsy cannot be fully acquired in clinical studies with humans. As a result, the use of appropriate animal models is essential. Some of these models replicate the natural history of symptomatic focal epilepsy with an initial epileptogenic insult, which is followed by an apparent latent period and by a subsequent period of chronic spontaneous seizures. Seizures are a combination of electrical and behavioral events that are able to induce chemical, molecular, and anatomic alterations. In this review, we summarize the most frequently used models of chronic epilepsy and models of acute seizures induced by chemoconvulsants, traumatic brain injury, and electrical or sound stimuli. Genetic models of absence seizures and models of seizures and status epilepticus in the immature brain were also examined. Major uses and limitations were highlighted, and neuropathological, behavioral, and neurophysiological similarities and differences between the model and the human equivalent were considered. The quest for seizure mechanisms can provide insights into overall brain functions and consciousness, and animal models of epilepsy will continue to promote the progress of both epilepsy and neurophysiology research.},

abstract = {The human brain is in constant flux, as distinct areas engage in transient communication to support basic behaviors as well as complex cognition. The collection of interactions between cortical and subcortical areas forms a functional brain network whose topology evolves with time. Despite the nontrivial dynamics that are germaine to this networked system, experimental evidence demonstrates that functional interactions organize into putative brain systems that facilitate different facets of cognitive compu-tation. We hypothesize that such dynamic functional networks are organized around a set of rules that constrain their spatial architecture – which brain regions may functionally interact – and their temporal architecture – how these interactions fluctuate over time. To objectively uncover these organizing principles, we apply an unsupervised machine learning approach called non-negative matrix factorization to time-evolving, resting state functional networks in 20 healthy subjects. This machine-learning approach automatically clusters temporally co-varying functional interactions into subgraphs that represent putative topological modes of dynamic functional architecture. We find that subgraphs are stratified based on both the underlying modular organization and the topographical distance of their strongest interactions: while many subgraphs are largely contained within modules, others span between modules and are expressed differently over time. The relationship between dynamic subgraphs and modular archi-tecture is further highlighted by the ability of time-varying subgraph expression to explain inter-individual differences in module reorganization. Collectively, these results point to the critical role subgraphs play in constraining the topography and topology of functional brain networks. More broadly, this machine learning approach opens a new door for understanding the architecture of dynamic functional networks during both task and rest states, and for probing alterations of that architecture in disease.},

abstract = {Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive control—a set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasks—a Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figures—each with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.},

Here, we address this challenge by developing an organic material-based, ultraconformable, biocompatible and scalable neural interface array (the 'NeuroGrid') that can record both local field potentials(LFPs) and action potentials from superficial cortical neurons without penetrating the brain surface. Spikes with features of interneurons and pyramidal cells were simultaneously acquired by multiple neighboring electrodes of the NeuroGrid, allowing for the isolation of putative single neurons in rats. Spiking activity demonstrated consistent phase modulation by ongoing brain oscillations and was stable in recordings exceeding 1 week's duration. We also recorded LFP-modulated spiking activity intraoperatively in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. The NeuroGrid constitutes an effective method for large-scale, stable recording of neuronal spikes in concert with local population synaptic activity, enhancing comprehension of neural processes across spatiotemporal scales and potentially facilitating diagnosis and therapy for brain disorders.},

abstract = {In magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG), spatial modelling of sensor data is necessary to make inferences about underlying brain activity. Most source reconstruction techniques belong to one of two approaches: point source models, which explain the data with a small number of equivalent current dipoles and distributed source or imaging models, which use thousands of dipoles. Much methodological research has been devoted to developing sophisticated Bayesian source imaging inversion schemes, while dipoles have received less such attention. Dipole models have their advantages; they are often appropriate summaries of evoked responses or helpful first approximations. Here, we propose a variational Bayesian algorithm that enables the fast Bayesian inversion of dipole models. The approach allows for specification of priors on all the model parameters. The posterior distributions can be used to form Bayesian confidence intervals for interesting parameters, like dipole locations. Furthermore, competing models (e.g., models with different numbers of dipoles) can be compared using their evidence or marginal likelihood. Using synthetic data, we found the scheme provides accurate dipole localizations. We illustrate the advantage of our Bayesian scheme, using a multi-subject EEG auditory study, where we compare competing models for the generation of the N100 component. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space. Results: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

abstract = {Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a dimension reduction method that has been widely used for various tasks including text mining, pattern analysis, clustering, and cancer class discovery. The mathematical formulation for NMF appears as a non-convex optimization problem, and various types of algorithms have been devised to solve the problem. The alternating nonnegative least squares (ANLS) framework is a block coordinate descent approach for solving NMF, which was recently shown to be theoretically sound and empirically efficient. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for NMF based on the ANLS framework. Our new algorithm builds upon the block principal pivoting method for the nonnegativity constrained least squares problem that overcomes some limitations of active set methods. We introduce ideas to efficiently extend the block principal pivoting method within the context of NMF computation. Our algorithm inherits the convergence theory of the ANLS framework and can easily be extended to other constrained NMF formulations. Comparisons of algorithms using datasets that are from real life applications as well as those artificially generated show that the proposed new algorithm outperforms existing ones in computational speed.},

This review covers four major topics: 1) material dependent properties of the photoelectric effect (conductor, semiconductor, organic, photoelectric work function (band gap)); 2) optic dependent properties of the photoelectric effect (single photon, multiphoton, entangled biphoton, intensity, wavelength, coherence); 3) strategies and limitations for avoiding/minimizing photoelectric effects; and 4) advantages of and applications for light-based bioelectronics (photo-bioelectronics).},

abstract = {We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m(-1)) and -690 Nm(-1), respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m(-1) and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = -2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of sigma(int) = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

abstract = {The last decades have witnessed substantial progress in optical technologies revolutionizing our ability to record and manipulate neural activity in genetically modified animal models. Meanwhile, human studies mostly rely on electrophysiological recordings of cortical potentials, which cannot be inferred from optical recordings, leading to a gap between our understanding of dynamics of microscale populations and brain-scale neural activity. By enabling concurrent integration of electrical and optical modalities, transparent graphene microelectrodes can close this gap. However, the high impedance of graphene constitutes a big challenge toward the widespread use of this technology. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that this high impedance of graphene microelectrodes is fundamentally limited by quantum capacitance. This quantum capacitance limit is overcome by creating a parallel conduction path using platinum nanoparticles. A 100 times reduction in graphene electrode impedance is achieved, while maintaining the high optical transparency crucial for deep two-photon microscopy. Using a transgenic mouse model, simultaneous electrical recording of cortical activity with high fidelity is demonstrated while imaging calcium signals at various cortical depths right beneath the transparent microelectrodes. Multimodal analysis of Ca 2+ spikes and cortical surface potentials offers unique opportunities to bridge our understanding of cellular dynamics and brain-scale neural activity.},

abstract = {Transparent microelectrode arrays have emerged as increasingly important tools for neuroscience by allowing simultaneous coupling of big and time-resolved electrophysiology data with optically measured, spatially and type resolved single neuron activity. Scaling down transparent electrodes to the length scale of a single neuron is challenging since conventional transparent conductors are limited by their capacitive electrode/electrolyte interface. In this study, we establish transparent microelectrode arrays with high performance, great biocompatibility, and comprehensive in vivo validations from a recently developed, bilayer-nanomesh material composite, where a metal layer and a low-impedance faradaic interfacial layer are stacked reliably together in a same transparent nanomesh pattern. Specifically, flexible arrays from 32 bilayer-nanomesh microelectrodes demonstrated near-unity yield with high uniformity, excellent biocompatibility, and great compatibility with state-of-the-art wireless recording and real-time artifact rejection system. The electrodes are highly scalable, with 130 kilohms at 1 kHz at 20 $\mu$m in diameter, comparable to the performance of microelectrodes in nontransparent Michigan arrays. The highly transparent, bilayer-nanomesh microelectrode arrays allowed in vivo two-photon imaging of single neurons in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex of awake mice, along with high-fidelity, simultaneous electrical recordings of visual-evoked activity, both in the multi-unit activity band and at lower frequencies by measuring the visual-evoked potential in the time domain. Together, these advances reveal the great potential of transparent arrays from bilayer-nanomesh microelectrodes for a broad range of utility in neuroscience and medical practices.},

Interneuron death and reorganization during epileptogenesis may disrupt the synchrony of hippocampal inhibition. To test this, we simultaneously recorded from the CA1 and dentate gyrus in pilocarpine-treated epileptic mice with silicon probes during head-fixed virtual navigation. We found desynchronized interneuron firing between the CA1 and dentate gyrus in epileptic mice. Since hippocampal interneurons control information processing, we tested whether CA1 spatial coding was altered in this desynchronized circuit, using a novel wire-free miniscope. We found that CA1 place cells in epileptic mice were unstable and completely remapped across a week. This spatial instability emerged around 6 weeks after status epilepticus, well after the onset of chronic seizures and interneuron death. Finally, CA1 network modeling showed that desynchronized inputs can impair the precision and stability of CA1 place cells. Together, these results demonstrate that temporally precise intrahippocampal communication is critical for spatial processing.},

abstract = {The central nervous system is composed of many individual units -- from cells to areas -- that are connected with one another in a complex pattern of functional interactions that supports perception, action, and cognition. One natural and parsimonious representation of such a system is a graph in which nodes (units) are connected by edges (interactions). While applicable across spatiotemporal scales, species, and cohorts, the traditional graph approach is unable to address the complexity of time-varying connectivity patterns that may be critically important for an understanding of emotional and cognitive state, task-switching, adaptation and development, or aging and disease progression. Here we survey a set of tools from applied mathematics that offer measures to characterize dynamic graphs. Along with this survey, we offer suggestions for visualization and a publicly-available MATLAB toolbox to facilitate the application of these metrics to existing or yet-to-be acquired neuroimaging data. We illustrate the toolbox by applying it to a previously published data set of time-varying functional graphs, but note that the tools can also be applied to time-varying structural graphs or to other sorts of relational data entirely. Our aim is to provide the neuroimaging community with a useful set of tools, and an intuition regarding how to use them, for addressing emerging questions that hinge on accurate and creative analyses of dynamic graphs.},

abstract = {The extensive distribution and simultaneous termination of seizures across cortical areas has led to the hypothesis that seizures are caused by large-scale coordinated networks spanning these areas. This view, however, is difficult to reconcile with most proposed mechanisms of seizure spread and termination, which operate on a cellular scale. We hypothesize that seizures evolve into self-organized structures wherein a small seizing territory projects high-intensity electrical signals over a broad cortical area. Here we investigate human seizures on both small and large electrophysiological scales. We show that the migrating edge of the seizing territory is the source of travelling waves of synaptic activity into adjacent cortical areas. As the seizure progresses, slow dynamics in induced activity from these waves indicate a weakening and eventual failure of their source. These observations support a parsimonious theory for how large-scale evolution and termination of seizures are driven from a small, migrating cortical area.},

abstract = {Objective: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) recorded from intracranial electrodes during epileptiform discharges have been proposed as a biomarker of epileptic brain sites and may also be a useful feature for seizure forecasting, with mixed results. Currently, pathological subclasses of HFOs have been defined primarily by frequency characteristics. Despite this, there has been limited investigation into the spatial context of HFOs with recruitment of local cortex into seizure discharging. We sought to further understand the biophysical underpinnings of ictal HFOs. Methods: Here we examine ictal HFOs from multi-scale electrophysiological recordings during spontaneous human rhythmic onset seizures. We compare features of ictal discharges in both the seizure core and penumbra, as defined by multiunit activity patterns. Results: We show marked differences in spectral features, unit coupling, and information theoretic characteristics of HFOs during ictal discharges before and after local seizure invasion. Furthermore, we tie these timing-related differences to different spatial domains of seizures, showing that eccentric, penumbral discharges are widely distributed and less useful for seizure localization, which may explain the variable utility of HFOs in seizure localization and forecasting. Interpretation: We thus identify two distinct classes of ictal HFOs, implying two different mechanisms underlying pathological HFOs with contrasting significance for seizure localization.

Typical large field of view microscopes do not resolve single cells, especially in the axial dimension. We developed a 2-photon random access mesoscope (2p- RAM) that allows high-resolution imaging anywhere within a volume spanning multiple brain areas ($\theta$ 5 mm x 1 mm cylinder). 2p-RAM resolution is near diffraction limited (lateral, 0.66 µm, axial 4.09 mm at the center; excitation wavelength = 970 nm; numerical aperture = 0.6) over a large range of excitation wavelengths. A fast three-dimensional scanning system allows efficient sampling of neural activity in arbitrary regions of interest across the entire imaging volume. We illustrate the use of the 2p-RAM by imaging neural activity in multiple, non-contiguous brain areas in transgenic mice expressing protein calcium sensors.},

Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse's ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.},

abstract = {6 3 5 a r t I C l e S Seizures and epilepsy have been recognized since antiquity, yet we continue to struggle to define and understand these paroxysms of neuronal activity. Epileptic seizures are commonly considered to be the result of monolithic, hypersynchronous activity arising from an imbalance between excitation and inhibition in large populations of cortical neurons 1-3. This view of ictal activity is highly simplified, and the level at which it breaks down is unclear. It is largely based on electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, which reflect the averaged activity of millions of neurons. Whereas some in vitro studies have shown that sparse and asynchronous neuronal activity evolves into a single hypersynchronous cluster with elevated spiking rates at seizure initiation 4,5 , as the canonical view would suggest, other animal model studies have supported a much less homogeneous progression in neuronal activity during seizures 6-8. How well these animal models capture mechanisms operating in human epilepsy remains an open question 9,10. Very few human studies have gone beyond macro-scopic scalp and intracranial EEG signals to examine neuronal spiking underlying seizures 11-14. Hence the behavior of single neurons in human epilepsy remains largely unknown. The reliance on the macroscopic information of the EEG has also dominated attempts at discovering physiological changes preceding the seizure. The obvious goal of this approach is in predicting and then preventing seizures 15,16. While in vitro and in vivo animal models suggest that different neuronal populations might have distinct roles during a preictal period 4-8,17-21 , reliable seizure prediction based on detection of preictal changes in human scalp and intracranial EEG has remained elusive 16. In addition, most seizures end abruptly and spontaneously, followed by a post-seizure attenuation in EEG activity 22. The underlying mechanisms governing this behavior are also not understood. Various potential mechanisms, including among others, glutamate depletion, profound inhibition, modulatory effects from subcortical structures and depolarization block, have been hypothesized to underlie seizure termination 22,23. Although these mechanisms clearly operate at the level of individual cells, to our knowledge, single-unit activity during this period has not been examined in humans. Such information could be useful in developing better strategies for seizure control and preventing status epilepticus 2{\ldots}},

abstract = {High frequency oscillations have been proposed as a clinically useful biomarker of seizure generating sites. We used a unique set of human microelectrode array recordings (four patients, 10 seizures), in which propagating seizure wavefronts could be readily identified, to investigate the basis of ictal high frequency activity at the cortical (subdural) surface. Sustained, repetitive transient increases in high gamma (80-150 Hz) amplitude, phase-locked to the low-frequency (1-25 Hz) ictal rhythm, correlated with strong multi-unit firing bursts synchronized across the core territory of the seizure. These repetitive high frequency oscillations were seen in recordings from subdural electrodes adjacent to the microelectrode array several seconds after seizure onset, following ictal wavefront passage. Conversely, microelectrode recordings demonstrating only low-level, heterogeneous neural firing correlated with a lack of high frequency oscillations in adjacent subdural recording sites, despite the presence of a strong low-frequency signature. Previously, we reported that this pattern indicates a failure of the seizure to invade the area, because of a feedforward inhibitory veto mechanism. Because multi-unit firing rate and high gamma amplitude are closely related, high frequency oscillations can be used as a surrogate marker to distinguish the core seizure territory from the surrounding penumbra. We developed an efficient measure to detect delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations based on cross-frequency coupling between high gamma amplitude and the low-frequency (1-25 Hz) ictal rhythm. When applied to the broader subdural recording, this measure consistently predicted the timing or failure of ictal invasion, and revealed a surprisingly small and slowly spreading seizure core surrounded by a far larger penumbral territory. Our findings thus establish an underlying neural mechanism for delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations, and provide a practical, efficient method for using them to identify the small ictal core regions. Our observations suggest that it may be possible to reduce substantially the extent of cortical resections in epilepsy surgery procedures without compromising seizure control.},

abstract = {Understanding seizure formation and spread remains a critical goal of epilepsy research. We used fast in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in male mouse neocortex to reconstruct, with single-cell resolution, the dynamics of acute (4-aminopyridine) focal cortical seizures as they originate within a spatially confined seizure initiation site (intrafocal region), and subsequently propagate into neighboring cortical areas (extrafocal region). We find that seizures originate as local neuronal ensembles within the initiation site. This abnormal hyperactivity engages increasingly larger areas in a saltatory fashion until it breaks into neighboring cortex, where it proceeds smoothly and is then detected electrophysiologically (LFP). Interestingly, PV inhibitory interneurons have spatially heterogeneous activity in intrafocal and extrafocal territories, ruling out a simple role of inhibition in seizure formation and spread. We propose a two-step model for the progression of focal seizures, where neuronal ensembles activate first, generating a microseizure, followed by widespread neural activation in a traveling wave through neighboring cortex during macroseizures.},

abstract = {Neocortical epilepsy is frequently drug-resistant. Surgery to remove the epileptogenic zone is only feasible in a minority of cases, leaving many patients without an effective treatment. We report the potential efficacy of gene therapy in focal neocortical epilepsy using a rodent model in which epilepsy is induced by tetanus toxin injection in the motor cortex. By applying several complementary methods that use continuous wireless electroencephalographic monitoring to quantify epileptic activity, we observed increases in high frequency activity and in the occurrence of epileptiform events. Pyramidal neurons in the epileptic focus showed enhanced intrinsic excitability consistent with seizure generation. Optogenetic inhibition of a subset of principal neurons transduced with halorhodopsin targeted to the epileptic focus by lentiviral delivery was sufficient to attenuate electroencephalographic seizures. Local lentiviral overexpression of the potassium channel Kv1.1 reduced the intrinsic excitability of transduced pyramidal neurons. Coinjection of this Kv1.1 lentivirus with tetanus toxin fully prevented the occurrence of electroencephalographic seizures. Finally, administration of the Kv1.1 lentivirus to an established epileptic focus progressively suppressed epileptic activity over several weeks without detectable behavioral side effects. Thus, gene therapy in a rodent model can be used to suppress seizures acutely, prevent their occurrence after an epileptogenic stimulus, and successfully treat established focal epilepsy.},

abstract = {Background: Novel treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy are required. New method: Optogenetics is a combination of optical and genetic methods used to control the activity of specific populations of excitable cells using light with high temporal and spatial resolution. Derived from microbial organisms, 'opsin' genes encode light-activated ion channels and pumps. Opsins can be genetically targeted to well-defined neuronal populations in mammalian brains using viral vectors. When exposed to light of an appropriate wavelength, the excitability of neurons can be increased or decreased optically on a millisecond timescale. Comparison with existing method(s): Alternative treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy such as vagal, cortical or subcortical stimulation, focal cooling, callosotomy, or ketogenic diet have met with limited success, whereas optogenetic approaches have shown considerable pre-clinical promise. Conclusions: Several groups have reported that optogenetic approaches successfully attenuated epileptiform activity in different rodent models of epilepsy, providing proof of the principle that this approach may translate to an effective treatment for epilepsy patients. However, further studies are required to determine the optimal opsin, in which types (or subtypes) of neurons it should be expressed, and what are the most efficient temporal profiles of photostimulation. Although invasive due to the need to inject a viral vector into the brain and implant a device to deliver light to opsin-transduced neurons, this approach has the potential to be effective in suppressing spontaneous seizures while avoiding the side-effects of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) or the need to permanently excise regions of the brain. Optogenetic approaches may treat drug-refractory epilepsies.},

We identified neuron types by colocalizing Ca2+ signals of a red-fluorescing indicator with genetically encoded markers. We reconstructed firing rate changes from Ca2+ signals by temporal deconvolution. This technique is efficient, dramatically enhances temporal resolution, facilitates data interpretation and permits analysis of odor-response patterns across thousands of neurons in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. Hence, temporally deconvolved Ca2+ imaging (TDCa imaging) resolves limitations of current optical recording techniques and is likely to be widely applicable because of its simplicity, robustness and generic principle. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

While much of the conversation has centered around publishing and conference participation, recent research in other fields has called attention to the prevalence of gender bias in citation practices. Because of the downstream effects that citations can have on visibility and career advancement, understanding and eliminating gender bias in citation practices is vital for addressing inequity in a scientific community. In this study, we sought to determine whether there is evidence of gender bias in the citation practices of neuroscientists. Utilizing data from five top neuroscience journals, we indeed find that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than would be expected if gender was not a factor in referencing. Importantly, we show that this overcitation of men and undercitation of women is driven largely by the citation practices of men, and is increasing with time despite greater diversity in the academy. We develop a co-authorship network to determine the degree to which homophily in researchers{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} social networks explains gendered citation practices and we find that men tend to overcite other men even when their social networks are representative of the field.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that seizures can spread and terminate across brain areas via a rich diversity of spatiotemporal patterns. In particular, while the location of the seizure onset area is usually in-variant across seizures in a same patient, the source of traveling (2-3 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) during seizures can either move with the slower propagating ictal wavefront or remain stationary at the seizure onset area. In addition, although most focal seizures terminate quasi-synchronously across brain areas, some evolve into distinct ictal clusters and terminate asynchronously. To provide a unifying perspective on the observed diversity of spatiotemporal dynamics for seizure spread and termination, we introduce here the Epileptor neural field model. Two mechanisms play an essential role. First, while the slow ictal wavefront propagates as a front in excitable neural media, the faster SWDs propagation results from coupled-oscillator dynamics. Second, multiple time scales interact during seizure spread, allowing for low-voltage fast-activity ({\textgreater}10 Hz) to hamper seizure spread and for SWD propagation to affect the way a seizure terminates. These dynamics, together with variations in short and long-range connectivity strength, play a central role on seizure spread, maintenance and termination. We demonstrate how Epileptor field models incorporating the above mechanisms predict the previously reported diversity in seizure spread patterns. Furthermore, we confirm the predictions for synchronous or asynchronous (clustered) seizure termination in human seizures recorded via stereotactic EEG. Our new insights into seizure spatiotemporal dynamics may also contribute to the development of new closed-loop neuromodulation therapies for focal epilepsy.},
