# Diversity Statement and Code Notebook

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/232916183.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/232916183)

Motivated from work by [J. D. Dworkin, K. A. Linn, E. G. Teich, P. Zurn, R. T. Shinohara, and D. S. Bassett (2020). bioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.03.894378](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.03.894378v1.full.pdf)

For `.pdf` and `.tex` templates of the statement, see the `/diversityStatement` directory in this repository.

A `.bib` file containing the references used in the statement can be found in `/diversityStatement/bibfile.bib`

## Diversity statement template

> Recent work in neuroscience and other fields has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Here we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought, form of contribution, gender, and other factors. We used automatic classification of gender based on the first names of the first and last authors [1, 7], with possible combinations including male/male, male/female, female/male, and female/female. Excluding self-citations to the first and last authors of our current paper, the references contain `A`% male/male, `B`% male/female, `C`% female/male, `D`% female/female, and `E`% unknown categorization. We look forward to future work that could help us to better understand how to support equitable practices in science.

# Instructions

The goal of the coding notebook is to clean your `.bib` file to only contain references that you have cited in your manuscript. This cleaned `.bib` will then be used to generate a data table of full first names that will be used to query the probabilistic gender classifier, [Gender API](https://gender-api.com). Proportions of the predicted gender for first and last author pairs (male/male, male/female, female/male, and female/female) will be calculated. 

1. Obtain a `.bib` file of your manuscript's reference list. You can do this with common reference managers. 

   * [Export `.bib` from Mendeley](https://blog.mendeley.com/2011/10/25/howto-use-mendeley-to-create-citations-using-latex-and-bibtex/)
   * [Export `.bib` from Zotero](https://libguides.mit.edu/ld.php?content_id=34248570)
   * [Export `.bib` from EndNote](https://www.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/EndNote.html)
   * [Export `.bib` from Read Cube Papers](https://support.papersapp.com/support/solutions/articles/30000024634-how-can-i-export-references-from-readcube-papers-)

2. Launch the Binder environment. Please refresh the page if the Binder does not load after 5-10 mins.

    [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dalejn/cleanBib/master)

3. Open the notebook `cleanBib.ipynb`. Follow the instructions above each code block. It can take 10 minutes to 1 hour complete all of the instructions, depending on the state and size of your `.bib` file. We expect that the most time-consuming step will be manually modifying the `.bib` file to find missing author names, fill incomplete entries, and fix formatting errors. These problems arise because automated methods of reference mangagers and Google Scholar sometimes can not retrieve full information, for example if some journals only provide an author's first initial instead of their full first name.

# FAQ

* Why do I receive an error when running the code?.
  * The most common errors are due to misformatted .bib files. Errors will usually provide an indication of the line or type of problem in the .bib file. They will require you to manually correct the `.bib` file of formatting errors or incomplete entries. If you cannot resolve an error, please open an `issue` and attach the error pasted into a `.txt` or a screenshot of the error. We will try to help resolve it.
* Will this method work on non-Western names?
  * Yes, the [Gender API supports 177 countries](https://gender-api.com/en/frequently-asked-questions?gclid=Cj0KCQiAmZDxBRDIARIsABnkbYTy9MHmGoR2uBhxEKANbT9B9EFVOSiRzbGeQi7nUn6ODH83s6-RZKwaAjpZEALw_wcB#which-countries-are-supported) but will classify genders with varying confidence. 
* Are self-citations included?
  * We do not include self-citations by default. We define self-citations as those including your first or last author as a co-author.
* What if a reference has only 1 author?
  * We count that author as both the first and last author.
* What about gender-neutral names?
  * We exclude names that cannot be classified with >70% confidence. These are reported in the `Diversity Statement` as "unknown." 
* Should I include the diversity statement references in the gender proportion calculation?
  * Please do not include the diversity statement references. The descriptive statistic of primary interest is of your citation practices.
* What is a `.bib` file?
  * The `.bib` file is a bibliography with tagged entry fields used by LaTeX to format a typesetted manuscript's reference list and its in-line citations. If you are not using LaTeX to write your manuscript, common reference managers that are linked to Microsoft Word or Google Docs also allow you to export `.bib` files (See Instructions, Step 1).
* What is an `.aux` file?
  * The `.aux` file is generated when you compile the `.tex` file to build your manuscript. It is linked to the `.bib` file(s) used to populate your manuscript's reference list and records the citations used.
* I have an idea to advance this project, suggestions about how to improve the notebook, and/or found a bug. Can I contribute?
  * Yes, please open an `issue` or `pull request`. We welcome feedback on any pain points in running this code notebook. If you contribute, please modify the `README.md` to credit yourself alphabetically in the `Contributors` section in the `pull request`.
